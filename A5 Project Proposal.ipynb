    "# Do healthy communities mean a better economy?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### By Ishna Kaul\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why are we doing this?\n",
    "\n",
    "For decades, there has been research to link health of citizens to the economic growth of a country. In a recent turn of events, a friend was involved in an accident in the United States (one of the stronger economies of the world) and had to struggle to get the medical care he deserved. Since that time, I read about more such experiences and a general displeasure towards healthcare facilities in the US. This made me wonder how access to healthcare, health of the citizens and growth in economy are related to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investment in health is not only a desirable, but also an essential priority for most societies. Investments in health and the design of health financing policies should be addressed in terms of the interaction between health and the economy. Just as growth, income, investment and employment are a function of the performance and quality of the economic system, its regulatory frameworks, trade policies, social capital and labor markets, etc., so health conditions (mortality, morbidity, disability) depend not just on standards of living, but on the actual performance of health systems themselves. My aim with this project is to go over some of these interactions [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why should we care about this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Healthcare spending is a critical expense for most nations and their citizens in order to stay healthy and cared for.\n",
    "The U.S. continues to spend the most on healthcare per person, even though health outcomes and quality of care is not often ranked highest. Many European countries follow the U.S. in healthcare spending, but the big difference is most of that cost is subsidized by the government while the U.S. relies on costly, private health insurance plans. My main focus with this project is to understand the underlying relationship between health and economic indicators and benchmark these for a few countries (USA, Switzerland, Australia, India, Brazil, China). My hypothesis is that a there is a strong and significant relationship between health of citizens of an economy and its growth. I believe that a poor healthcare system is a clear indicator of low economic growth of a country.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access to healthcare has for long been an important factor in the improvement of the quality of life as well as the economy of a country. While many countries have taken steps to ensure access to health I wish to investigate the success and effects of this. Is the bias that exists in most heads: Great Economy = Excellent Healthcare true?\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be considering the following human-centered data science perspectives:\n",
    "- Incorporate current affairs around the world focusing on healthcare and economic growth\n",
    "- Read research papers and work focusing on healthcare and economic growth\n",
    "- Focus on the research questions asked and how they do/donâ€™t defy my assumptions about the system\n",
    "- Incorporating visualizations and quantitative analysis to support the results and inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "For my analysis, I will be considering developed countries: United States of America, Switzerland, Ireland, Iceland, Sweden and Australia, developing countries: India, China and Brazil. I won't be considering any under-developed countries in my analysis to avoid any skewness in my analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Research Question 1: In the past 10 years, do countries who have higher current healthcare expenditure have a higher growth rate for GDP?\n",
    "\n",
    "GDP is often in our heads considered a direct measurement of growth for our economy. It will be interesting to see how spending on healthcare is related to its growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Research Question 2: In the past 10 years, do countries with lower age dependency ratio have higher labour force participation rate?\n",
    "\n",
    "The age dependency ratio expresses the relationship between three age groups within a population: ages 0-15, 16-64 and 65-plus. Higher values indicate a greater level of age-related dependency in the population. Is this dependency decreasing as labour force participation rises?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Research Question 3: How does nation adjusted net income per capita vary with maternal mortality ratio in a country?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is net income corresponding to money spent on maternal care, especially during pregenancy and childbirth? If yes, then is the country making maternal care expensive? If not, is the maternal mortality ratio rising?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Research Question 4: How does the annual population growth rate compare to the diabetes prevalance in a developed country?\n",
    "\n",
    "Diabetes is the most prevalent disease of our times. Are the developed countries contributing to more diabetic prone population in the world?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Research Question 5: How does the life expectancy at birth vary with the GFCF of a country?\n",
    "\n",
    "Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) is the acquisition of produced assets (including purchases of second-hand assets), including the production of such assets by producers for their own use, minus disposals [16]. It is a strong indicator of economic progress of a country. Is it okay to expect a healthier life expectancy for countries with higher GFCF?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using measure of central dispersion such as mean, standard deviation, range to understand the underlying distribution of the mentioned factors. We will also be using statistical relationships such as correlation to measure linear relationships between variables. We might also use hypothesis testing and t-tests for some of our analysis. We will be using machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, and visualisation aids, such as box-plots to understand outliers, scatterplots, lineplots and barplots to visualise the results better. Overall, I will be analyzing quantitative and statistical evaluation metrics such as correlation, regression, p-values and confidence intervals, in addition to visualizing bar plots, time series plot, stack plots for comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "I plan to use the python programming language with the pandas, numpy, scikit-learn package and matplotlib for all tasks including data import, cleaning, analysis and visualization. I plan to produce a jupyter Notebook to document each step of the research process. The notebook will support reproducibility in case others wish to duplicate or expand upon my work in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be using the World Bank Open Data [2] Free which is an open access to global development data. More specifically, I will be using the World Development Indicators data [3]. The World Development Indicators is a compilation of relevant, high-quality, and internationally comparable statistics about global development and the fight against poverty. The database contains 1,600 time series indicators for 217 economies and more than 40 country groups, with data for many indicators going back more than 50 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The World Bank collects and processes large amounts of data and generates them on the basis of economic models. These data and models have gradually been made available to the public in a way that encourages reuse, whereas the recent publications describing them are available as open access under a Creative Commons Attribution License. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have 10 csv files with indicator values through the years and the country. Going into further details, I want to compare the following metrics and base my analysis and research on the following mentioned spheres. To measure the economic development of a country, I will be using the following metrics:\n",
    "- GDP per capita growth rate [4] \n",
    "- Adjusted Net National Income per capita growth rate [6]\n",
    "- Annual Population growth rate [7]\n",
    "- Gross Fixed Capital Formation annual growth rate [8]\n",
    "- Labor force participation rate, total (% of total population ages 15-64) [9]\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure Healthcare, we have the following indicators:\n",
    "- Current Health Expenditure per capita [10]\n",
    "- Maternal Mortality Ratio [11]\n",
    "- Age Dependency Ratio [12]\n",
    "- Life Expectancy at Birth [13]\n",
    "- Diabetes prevalence (% of population ages 20 to 79) [14]\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "While the studies I have cited as inspiration have drawn conclusions about healthcare affecting a host nation's economy, I do believe that such studies, more often than not, come under the usual \"correlation vs causation\" conundrum. We know that correlation only measures linear relationships and ignores non linear relationships. My analysis might have a few similar loopholes, but I will try to cover as much as possible through rigorous research and analysis. Additionally, the listed data points that I am considering are not exhaustive. There are many other factors that reflect healthcare and economic growth of a country. Given the paucity of time and domain knowledge, I picked out ones I felt will deliver the best results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "While, it's unlikely this project will break new ground, it will improve my own understanding about who contributes to local political campaigns and how much they contribute.. However, it is a good exercise, verifying the claims made by the authors who have published the research on similar lines. Additionally, there are multiple studies on how spending on healthcare slows the economy. So, we might be looking at long term relationship of healthcare and economics which can be difficult to measure in the purview of this project but given the data and the time we have, I will try and make the best use of it to uncover underlying relationships between health and economic growth of a country.\n",
